# Source Code

This directory contains the source code for the project.

The folders and files for this folder are as follows:
- [client](https://github.com/PlutosCapstone/Plutos/tree/main/src/client) - Client/frontend source code
- [server](https://github.com/PlutosCapstone/Plutos/tree/main/src/server) - Server/backend source code


## Cloning the project
Open up your code editor and cd to a path where you want to clone the project. For me, I want my project in my desktop so I have the following path

You can open a new terminal in VSCode by clicking Terminal >> New Terminal or by dragging the bottom bar up. Make sure that you are using a Unix based shell as commands will be different if you are using windows (i.e. the command prompt).

Clone the project by using the command: **git clone https://github.com/PlutosCapstone/Plutos.git**

By now you should have something that looks like what I have:

Cd into the Capstone src folder by doing **cd src/Plutos** or click File >> Open Folder >> src >> Plutos if you only want that folder (we don't really need the other folders so we can just navigate this way.

This should be now where you're at:

At this point, feel free to look into the codebase.
