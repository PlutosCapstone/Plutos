\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

This document will provide a detailed plan for the Verification and Validation
(V\&V) of Plutos. Below is an overview of what will be covered in this document:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \hyperlink{section.2}{2 General Information}: This section will provide a brief overview of
	the software being tested, its objectives, challenge level, and extras.
	\item \hyperlink{section.3}{3 Plan}: This section will outline the V\&V team roles, the delegation
	of roles to team members, and the V\&V plan.
	\item \hyperlink{section.4}{4 System Tests}: This section will detail the system tests for
	functional and nonfunctional requirements, and traceability between test
	cases and requirements.
	\item \hyperlink{section.5}{5 Unit Test Description}: This section will provide an overview of the
	unit testing scope, unit tests for functional and nonfunctional
	requirements, and traceability between unit tests and modules.
\end{itemize}



\section{General Information}

\subsection{Summary}

This V\&V document outlines the testing approach for Plutos to ensure the
application meets the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the
SRS document. The verification process will confirm the functionality of
components such as receipt scanning, item recognition, and categorization
function as intended, while validation efforts will focus on ensuring usability,
performance, and security standards are met for an optimal user experience.


\subsection{Objectives}

\wss{State what is intended to be accomplished.  The objective will be around
  the qualities that are most important for your project.  You might have
  something like: ``build confidence in the software correctness,''
  ``demonstrate adequate usability.'' etc.  You won't list all of the qualities,
  just those that are most important.}

\wss{You should also list the objectives that are out of scope.  You don't have 
the resources to do everything, so what will you be leaving out.  For instance, 
if you are not going to verify the quality of usability, state this.  It is also 
worthwhile to justify why the objectives are left out.}

\wss{The objectives are important because they highlight that you are aware of 
limitations in your resources for verification and validation.  You can't do everything, 
so what are you going to prioritize?  As an example, if your system depends on an 
external library, you can explicitly state that you will assume that external library 
has already been verified by its implementation team.}

\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

The challenge level for the project is \textbf{general}. The extras that will be included are: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Requirements elicitation}: Surveys and interviews have been conducted
	as part of developing our Software Requriements Specfication (SRS).
	\item \textbf{Usability testing}: As part of our validation plan, we will conduct
	usability testing in which users will interact with the Plutos application and
	evaluate their experience.
\end{itemize}

describe the V\&V plan for the following components:
\begin{itemize}
	\item The SRS
	\item The design
	\item The V\&V
	\item The implementation
\end{itemize}
Following this, there will be a subssections detailing the automated testing and
verification tools, as well as the software validation plan.


\newpage
\subsection{Verification and Validation Team}

There will be a total of 7 distinct roles when it comes to our verification and validation team.
These roles will be split amongst team members and members may share the same secondary roles to facilitate a broader range of tests without overwhelming one person.
This division allows each team member to specialize in a certain aspect of our app when it comes to verification and validation. 
Attached below is a list of roles available in our VnV group along with the descriptions of what each role entails. \\

\noindent \textbf{VnV Roles}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
  include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
  primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
issue tracker?}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsubsection{Approaches for SRS Verifiation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Peer Review Feedback:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each team member will review the SRS individually and provide ad hoc feedback. They will focus on identifying ambiguous language, incomplete requirements, and inconsistencies.
		\item Each reviewer will log feedback in a shared document, categorizing issues by priority (e.g., high, medium, low).
	\end{itemize}
	\item Primary Reviewer Session:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A primary reviewer from the team, ideally someone with experience in requirements verification, will perform a detailed examination. They will document findings, focusing on critical areas such as requirement clarity, feasibility, and completeness.
	\end{itemize}
	\item External Peer Feedback:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If possible, solicit feedback from classmates or others familiar with requirements engineering. They can offer objective insights and identify issues that may have been overlooked internally.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\subsubsection{Structured Internal Review Process}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Initial Team Meeting:\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Hold a structured review meeting where team members present and discuss major sections of the SRS. Key points of focus should include functional requirements, assumptions, and constraints.
		\item Prepare a set of questions to guide the discussion, such as:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item "Are the requirements unambiguous and complete?"
			\item "Is each requirement feasible and realistic?"
			\item "Do the requirements adequately represent the user's needs?"
			\item "Are there any areas that might be challenging to test or verify?"
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Task-Based Inspection:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Team members can take turns as "inspectors," responsible for a task-based evaluation of key areas:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Ensuring requirements align with project goals.
			\item Verifying each requirement's testability and clarity.
			\item Checking that the document is organized and easy to navigate.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Issue Tracker:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Use an issue tracker or a collaborative tool to manage findings and resolutions. Each issue should include:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A summary of the issue.
			\item Priority level (e.g., high, medium, low).
			\item Suggested resolution steps.
			\item A status field for tracking progress until resolved.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\wss{The verification and validation plan is an artifact that should also be
verified.  Techniques for this include review and mutation testing.}

\wss{The review will include reviews by your classmates}

\wss{Create a checklists?}

\subsection{Implementation Verification Plan}

\wss{You should at least point to the tests listed in this document and the unit
  testing plan.}

\wss{In this section you would also give any details of any plans for static
  verification of the implementation.  Potential techniques include code
  walkthroughs, code inspection, static analyzers, etc.}

\wss{The final class presentation in CAS 741 could be used as a code
walkthrough.  There is also a possibility of using the final presentation (in
CAS741) for a partial usability survey.}

\newpage

\subsection{Automated Testing and Verification Tools}

\wss{What tools are you using for automated testing.  Likely a unit testing
  framework and maybe a profiling tool, like ValGrind.  Other possible tools
  include a static analyzer, make, continuous integration tools, test coverage
  tools, etc.  Explain your plans for summarizing code coverage metrics.
  Linters are another important class of tools.  For the programming language
  you select, you should look at the available linters.  There may also be tools
  that verify that coding standards have been respected, like flake9 for
  Python.}

\wss{If you have already done this in the development plan, you can point to
that document.}

\wss{The details of this section will likely evolve as you get closer to the
  implementation.}

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{Unit Testing Frameworks}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Jest}: Jest is the default testing framework for React Native applications. It supports TypeScript, has a rich API for writing unit tests, and comes with built-in mocking capabilities.
		\item \textbf{React Testing Library}: This library works well with Jest for testing React components, focusing on user interactions and component behavior rather than implementation details.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Static Analysis Tools}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{ESLint}: ESLint is a powerful linter for JavaScript and TypeScript. It can be configured with TypeScript support to enforce coding standards, detect potential errors, and maintain code quality. It can also be extended with plugins for React and serves as industry best practices for JavaScript/TypeScript related-projects.
		\item \textbf{Prettier}: Integrating Prettier alongside ESLint helps ensure consistent code formatting across the codebase, which helps in improving readability.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Continuous Integration (CI) Tools}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{GitHub Actions}: This tool can be set up to run workflows that execute tests, linters, and builds automatically on every pull request or commit, ensuring that code quality is maintained consistently (i.e. Husky).
		\item \textbf{Jenkins}: Jenkins is an open-source automation server that facilitates continuous integration and continuous deployment processes. It can be configured to automatically run tests, linting, and builds every time code is pushed to the repository, ensuring that code quality is maintained consistently.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Test Coverage Tools}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Istanbul (nyc)}: Istanbul is a code coverage tool that integrates with Jest, providing detailed reports on which parts of the codebase are covered by tests, helping to identify untested code.
		\item \textbf{Codecov or Coveralls}: These services can be used to visualize and summarize code coverage metrics after each build, providing insights into overall coverage and trends over time.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Profiling Tools}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{React Native Performance Monitor:}: This built-in tool in React Native helps track performance metrics such as frame rates and memory usage, providing insights into the app's performance.
		\item \textbf{Flipper}: A platform for debugging mobile apps, Flipper offers a variety of plugins that assist in profiling and monitoring app performance.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Mutation Testing}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Stryker}: Stryker is a mutation testing framework for JavaScript and TypeScript. It can help assess the effectiveness of tests by introducing small changes in the code (mutations) and checking if the tests can catch them.
	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Plans for Summarizing Code Coverage Metrics}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Daily/Weekly Reports:}: The CI pipeline can be configured to generate code coverage reports with every build and aggregate these reports weekly. Tools like Codecov can be used to visualize trends over time.
		\item \textbf{Review Meetings}: Regular review meetings can be conducted to discuss coverage metrics with the team, identifying areas needing improvement and setting goals for coverage percentages.
		\item \textbf{Integrate Coverage Reports in PRs}: Coverage reports should be included in pull request reviews, ensuring that any code changes are evaluated in the context of their impact on overall coverage.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent For additional information, please consult the development plan.
\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\section{System Tests}

\wss{There should be text between all headings, even if it is just a roadmap of
the contents of the subsections.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Subsets of the tests may be in related, so this section is divided into
  different areas.  If there are no identifiable subsets for the tests, this
  level of document structure can be removed.}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.}

\subsubsection{Area of Testing1}

\wss{It would be nice to have a blurb here to explain why the subsections below
  cover the requirements.  References to the SRS would be good here.  If a section
  covers tests for input constraints, you should reference the data constraints
  table in the SRS.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-id1\\}

Type: \wss{Functional, Dynamic, Manual, Automatic, Static etc. Most will
  be automatic}
					
Initial State:

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}

This is where you can place additional information.

\subsection{Symbolic Parameters}

The definition of the test cases will call for SYMBOLIC\_CONSTANTS.
Their values are defined in this section for easy maintenance.

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
