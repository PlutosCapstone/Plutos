\section{General Information}

This section will outline the summary of the V\&V document, the objectives of
the process, the challenge level and extras of the project, and the relevant
external documentation that will be referenced in this document.

\subsection{Summary}

This V\&V document outlines the testing approach for Plutos to ensure the
application meets the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the
SRS document. The verification process will confirm the functionality of
components such as receipt scanning, item recognition, and categorization
function as intended, while validation efforts will focus on ensuring usability,
performance, and security standards are met for an optimal user experience.


\subsection{Objectives}

This subsection will provide an overview of the V\&V objectives that are
in-scope and out-of-scope for the Plutos application.

\subsubsection{In-Scope V\&V Objectives}

The following are the V\&V objectives, outlining what is intended to be verified
or validated as part of the V\&V process: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Accurate Data Extraction and Categorization}: Ensure that the
machine learning (ML) model accurately extracts key information from receipts
and correctly categorizes it by expense type. This is critical to providing
users with precise budgeting insights. The accuracy requirements are denoted in
the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
	\item \textbf{Seamless User Experience}: Prioritize usability by designing
an intuitive and responsive interface that simplifies the process of scanning
and categorizing receipts. The app should be easy to navigate, allowing users to
view spending summaries effortlessly. 
	\item \textbf{Real-Time Budgeting Feedback} Provide timely updates on
spending habits to make users aware of their financial status. This feature will
empower users to make informed spending decisions based on real-time data.
	\item \textbf{Security and Privacy} Securely handle all user data, with
particular attention to sensitive financial information. This objective includes
encrypting stored data and ensuring compliance with relevant data protection
regulations. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Out-of-Scope V\&V Objectives}

The following are the V\&V objectives that are out-of-scope due to time or
resource constraints:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{In-Depth Usability Testing with All User Types} While basic
usability will be validated, comprehensive testing with diverse user
demographics and accessibility concerns is out of scope due to resource
limitations. Feedback gathered post-launch may help inform future usability
improvements. 
	\item \textbf{Verification of External Libraries} The application will use
external libraries for image processing and data handling, assuming these
libraries have been rigorously tested by their developers. We will prioritize
testing our AI model and app functionality rather than the underlying libraries
to focus resources on core functionality. 
	\item \textbf{Accuracy for Poor-Quality Receipts and Non-Common Items}:
Currently, the receipt scanner focuses on high-quality receipts containing
commonly purchased items for students. While expanding the application to
support lower-quality receipts and less common items is planned for future
phases, this enhancement is out of scope for now due to the complexity of
training the ML model during our timeline.

\end{itemize}



\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

The challenge level for the project is \textbf{general}. The extras that will be included are: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Requirements elicitation}: Surveys and interviews have been conducted
	as part of developing our Software Requriements Specfication (SRS).
	\item \textbf{Usability testing}: As part of our validation plan, we will conduct
	usability testing in which users will interact with the Plutos application and
	evaluate their experience.

\subsection{Verification and Validation Plan Verification Plan}

Creating a Verification and Validation (V\&V) plan for a smart AI budgeting app requires a structured and systematic approach to confirm that the application operates accurately, efficiently, and reliably under real-world conditions.
This app uses advanced AI to parse receipt images, extract relevant information, and categorize expenses, which presents additional challenges for the V\&V process.
Unlike traditional software applications, an AI-driven app requires validation not only of standard software functionalities but also of the AI model's performance in accurately interpreting various receipt formats, layouts, and data entries.
This means that the V\&V plan must address both classic software testing elements (such as unit and integration testing) and specific AI model evaluation techniques, like model validation and performance testing, to ensure that the app delivers consistent results. \\

Given the diverse functionality—spanning expense tracking, budgeting, and financial forecasting—this V\&V approach must encompass both software-level testing and user-centric assessments to verify usability and accuracy from an end-user perspective.
Below is a comprehensive list of recommended V\&V techniques and a corresponding checklist, each tailored to ensure that the budgeting app meets its design specifications and delivers high-quality, reliable outcomes for users.

\subsubsection{V\&V Techniques for Plutos App}

	\item \textbf{Code Review}: Structured code reviews help to maintain code quality and identify potential issues in the receipt parsing and expense categorization components.
	\item \textbf{Unit Testing}:Unit tests should cover the core functions, especially those related to parsing and categorizing. Test cases should address a range of inputs, including expected, edge, and invalid cases.
	\item \textbf{Integration Testing}: Integration testing ensures that the AI model and app components work together seamlessly, verifying the accuracy and consistency of data processing.
	\item \textbf{System Testing}: System testing is necessary to evaluate the full app functionality, making sure that expense tracking, budgeting, and forecasting features meet the specified requirements.
	\item \textbf{Acceptance Testing}: End-user testing allows the team to validate that the app performs well in real-world settings, especially in accurately parsing receipts of various formats.
	\item \textbf{Mutation Testing}: Mutation testing can be used to check the effectiveness of the test cases and to identify any weaknesses in the testing approach.
	\item \textbf{Regression Testing}: Regression testing is essential to ensure that updates or changes in the AI model or app features do not interfere with existing functionality.
	\item \textbf{User Interface (UI) Testing}: UI testing helps confirm that the app interface is user-friendly, responsive, and consistent across different devices.
	\item \textbf{Model Validation}: The AI model should be validated on labeled data to check its performance, especially for accuracy in categorizing expenses based on parsed information.
	\item \textbf{Performance Testing}: Performance tests can be conducted to measure the app's speed and reliability, especially when processing large receipts or handling multiple users.
	\item \textbf{Security Testing}: Security testing ensures that financial data is stored and transmitted securely, with protections in place for data encryption and user access.

\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\wss{For teams without an external supervisor, user testing can serve the same purpose 
as a Rev 0 demo for the supervisor.}

\wss{This section might reference back to the SRS verification section.}

\textbf{Description:} The language and terminology used throughout the application's UI must align with users' mental models, using familiar terms.

\textbf{Type:} Manual
					
\textbf{Initial State:} The application is deployed.
					
\textbf{Input/Condition:} The user/tester evaluates the UI language and terminology.
					
\textbf{Output/Result:} The system must use non-technical, familiar terms throughout the UI.
					
\textbf{How the Test Will Be Performed:} The user/tester will manually navigate the UI to assess the terminology used and provide feedback on its alignment with user expectations.

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Regulatory Tests}

This subsection covers tests required to ensure compliance with relevant regulations and standards. \\
\textit{Nonfunctional Requirements: NFR40 - NFR 41}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-REG-1\\}

\textbf{Description:} The system must comply with Canada's Privacy Act and Financial Administration Act to ensure the privacy and security of user data and the secure handling of financial information.

\textbf{Type:} Manual
					
\textbf{Initial State:} The system is fully implemented and operational.
					
\textbf{Input/Condition:} The user/tester reviews the system's data handling policies and financial procedures.
					
\textbf{Output/Result:} The system must demonstrate adherence to both regulatory acts through documented policies and secure practices.
					
\textbf{How the Test Will Be Performed:} The user/tester will manually examine relevant documentation, assess data handling procedures, and conduct interviews with compliance and development teams to verify compliance with both the Privacy Act and the Financial Administration Act.

\end{enumerate}

\section{Unit Test Description}

This section will be filled after completion of the MIS document.
% \wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
%   document) has been completed.}

% \wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
% philosophy for test case selection.}  

% \wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
% For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
% can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
% approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
% and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
% and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
% needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

This section will be filled after completion of the MIS document.

% \wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
%   developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
%   verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
%   have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
%   explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

This section will be filled after completion of the MIS document.

% \wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
%   appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
%   technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

% \subsubsection{Module 1}

% \wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
%   References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
%   perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
%   tests were selected.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

This section will be filled after completion of the MIS document.

% \wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
%   performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
%   nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

% \wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
%   mentioned functional tests.}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete the verification and validation of your project?
  Examples of possible knowledge and skills include dynamic testing knowledge,
  static testing knowledge, specific tool usage, Valgrind etc.  You should look to
  identify at least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
