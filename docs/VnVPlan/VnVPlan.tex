\wss{The intention of the VnV plan is to increase confidence in the software.
However, this does not mean listing every verification and validation technique
that has ever been devised.  The VnV plan should also be a \textbf{feasible}
plan. Execution of the plan should be possible with the time and team available.
If the full plan cannot be completed during the time available, it can either be
modified to ``fake it'', or a better solution is to add a section describing
what work has been completed and what work is still planned for the future.}

\wss{The VnV plan is typically started after the requirements stage, but before
the design stage.  This means that the sections related to unit testing cannot
initially be completed.  The sections will be filled in after the design stage
is complete.  the final version of the VnV plan should have all sections filled
in.}

\newpage

\section{General Information}

This section will outline the summary of the V\&V document, the objectives of
the process, the challenge level and extras of the project, and the relevant
external documentation that will be referenced in this document.

\subsection{Summary}

This V\&V document outlines the testing approach for Plutos to ensure the
application meets the functional and non-functional requirements outlined in the
SRS document. The verification process will confirm the functionality of
components such as receipt scanning, item recognition, and categorization
function as intended, while validation efforts will focus on ensuring usability,
performance, and security standards are met for an optimal user experience.


\subsection{Objectives}

This subsection will provide an overview of the V\&V objectives that are
in-scope and out-of-scope for the Plutos application.

\subsubsection{In-Scope V\&V Objectives}

The following are the V\&V objectives, outlining what is intended to be verified
or validated as part of the V\&V process: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Accurate Data Extraction and Categorization}: Ensure that the
machine learning (ML) model accurately extracts key information from receipts
and correctly categorizes it by expense type. This is critical to providing
users with precise budgeting insights. The accuracy requirements are denoted in
the Software Requirements Specification (SRS).
	\item \textbf{Seamless User Experience}: Prioritize usability by designing
an intuitive and responsive interface that simplifies the process of scanning
and categorizing receipts. The app should be easy to navigate, allowing users to
view spending summaries effortlessly. 
	\item \textbf{Real-Time Budgeting Feedback} Provide timely updates on
spending habits to make users aware of their financial status. This feature will
empower users to make informed spending decisions based on real-time data.
	\item \textbf{Security and Privacy} Securely handle all user data, with
particular attention to sensitive financial information. This objective includes
encrypting stored data and ensuring compliance with relevant data protection
regulations. 
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Out-of-Scope V\&V Objectives}

The following are the V\&V objectives that are out-of-scope due to time or
resource constraints:
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{In-Depth Usability Testing with All User Types} While basic
usability will be validated, comprehensive testing with diverse user
demographics and accessibility concerns is out of scope due to resource
limitations. Feedback gathered post-launch may help inform future usability
improvements. 
	\item \textbf{Verification of External Libraries} The application will use
external libraries for image processing and data handling, assuming these
libraries have been rigorously tested by their developers. We will prioritize
testing our AI model and app functionality rather than the underlying libraries
to focus resources on core functionality. 
	\item \textbf{Accuracy for Poor-Quality Receipts and Non-Common Items}:
Currently, the receipt scanner focuses on high-quality receipts containing
commonly purchased items for students. While expanding the application to
support lower-quality receipts and less common items is planned for future
phases, this enhancement is out of scope for now due to the complexity of
training the ML model during our timeline.

\end{itemize}



\subsection{Challenge Level and Extras}

The challenge level for the project is \textbf{general}. The extras that will be included are: 
\begin{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Requirements elicitation}: Surveys and interviews have been conducted
	as part of developing our Software Requriements Specfication (SRS).
	\item \textbf{Usability testing}: As part of our validation plan, we will conduct
	usability testing in which users will interact with the Plutos application and
	evaluate their experience.
\end{itemize}

\wss{Your teammates.  Maybe your supervisor.
  You should do more than list names.  You should say what each person's role is
  for the project's verification.  A table is a good way to summarize this information.}

\subsection{SRS Verification Plan}

\wss{List any approaches you intend to use for SRS verification.  This may
  include ad hoc feedback from reviewers, like your classmates (like your
  primary reviewer), or you may plan for something more rigorous/systematic.}

\wss{If you have a supervisor for the project, you shouldn't just say they will
read over the SRS.  You should explain your structured approach to the review.
Will you have a meeting?  What will you present?  What questions will you ask?
Will you give them instructions for a task-based inspection?  Will you use your
issue tracker?}

\wss{Maybe create an SRS checklist?}

\subsubsection{Approaches for SRS Verifiation}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Peer Review Feedback:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Each team member will review the SRS individually and provide ad hoc feedback. They will focus on identifying ambiguous language, incomplete requirements, and inconsistencies.
		\item Each reviewer will log feedback in a shared document, categorizing issues by priority (e.g., high, medium, low).
	\end{itemize}
	\item Primary Reviewer Session:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item A primary reviewer from the team, ideally someone with experience in requirements verification, will perform a detailed examination. They will document findings, focusing on critical areas such as requirement clarity, feasibility, and completeness.
	\end{itemize}
	\item External Peer Feedback:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item If possible, solicit feedback from classmates or others familiar with requirements engineering. They can offer objective insights and identify issues that may have been overlooked internally.
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\newpage

\subsubsection{Structured Internal Review Process}

\begin{itemize}
	\item Initial Team Meeting:\
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Hold a structured review meeting where team members present and discuss major sections of the SRS. Key points of focus should include functional requirements, assumptions, and constraints.
		\item Prepare a set of questions to guide the discussion, such as:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item "Are the requirements unambiguous and complete?"
			\item "Is each requirement feasible and realistic?"
			\item "Do the requirements adequately represent the user's needs?"
			\item "Are there any areas that might be challenging to test or verify?"
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Task-Based Inspection:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Team members can take turns as "inspectors," responsible for a task-based evaluation of key areas:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item Ensuring requirements align with project goals.
			\item Verifying each requirement's testability and clarity.
			\item Checking that the document is organized and easy to navigate.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
	\item Issue Tracker:
	\begin{itemize}
		\item Use an issue tracker or a collaborative tool to manage findings and resolutions. Each issue should include:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item A summary of the issue.
			\item Priority level (e.g., high, medium, low).
			\item Suggested resolution steps.
			\item A status field for tracking progress until resolved.
		\end{itemize}
	\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

	\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Plans for Summarizing Code Coverage Metrics}
	\begin{itemize}
		\item \textbf{Daily/Weekly Reports:}: The CI pipeline can be configured to generate code coverage reports with every build and aggregate these reports weekly. Tools like Codecov can be used to visualize trends over time.
		\item \textbf{Review Meetings}: Regular review meetings can be conducted to discuss coverage metrics with the team, identifying areas needing improvement and setting goals for coverage percentages.
		\item \textbf{Integrate Coverage Reports in PRs}: Coverage reports should be included in pull request reviews, ensuring that any code changes are evaluated in the context of their impact on overall coverage.
	\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\noindent For additional information, please consult the development plan.
\subsection{Software Validation Plan}

\wss{If there is any external data that can be used for validation, you should
  point to it here.  If there are no plans for validation, you should state that
  here.}

\wss{You might want to use review sessions with the stakeholder to check that
the requirements document captures the right requirements.  Maybe task based
inspection?}

\wss{For those capstone teams with an external supervisor, the Rev 0 demo should 
be used as an opportunity to validate the requirements.  You should plan on 
demonstrating your project to your supervisor shortly after the scheduled Rev 0 demo.  
The feedback from your supervisor will be very useful for improving your project.}

\section{System Tests}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

The following test cases are divided into subsets corresponding to major functional areas in the application, as detailed in the Software Requirements Specification (SRS) document. 
Each subset addresses a specific functional component, including user account management, receipt scanning and processing, database management, item recognition and categorization, and financial tracking. 
These tests will help verify the functional requirements outlined in the SRS and will help with the creation of those tests to verify the specified functional requirements.

\subsubsection{User Account Management Tests}

This subsection covers tests required to verify tests revolving around user account management. The user account manager allows users to create an account, update it, and log in and out.\\
\textit{Functional Requirements: FR1 - FR5}

\begin{enumerate}

\item{test-UAM-1\\}

\textbf{Description:} The user should be able to create an account with specified name, email address and password

\textbf{Control:} Manual
					
\textbf{Initial State:} The app is on the account creation screen and there is no existing account with the test email
					
\textbf{Input:} Name, valid email, and password
					
\textbf{Output:} Account creation is successful, and the user is redirected to the login screen

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} This test ensures that the application allows users to create an account. The manager expects a valid name with no numbers or special characters, a valid email (existing email of correct email format) and a password that only contains certain characters to prevent SQL injection
					
\textbf{How test will be performed:} The test will be performed by providing instructions to a user/tester to enter valid name, email and password submissions. They will then determine if the test is successful by verifying that the actual output matches the expected output (as provided in the instructions/referenced in this document)

\item{test-UAM-2\\}

\textbf{Description:} The user should be able to login with valid credentials

\textbf{Control:} Manual
					
\textbf{Initial State:} The app is on the login page and a registered account has been created with the corresponding testing credentials
					
\textbf{Input:} Email and password
					
\textbf{Output:} The app is on the login page and a registered account has been created with the corresponding testing credentials

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} This test ensures that only authenticated users may access the app's functionalities

\textbf{How test will be performed:} The test will be performed by having a user/tester provide valid credentials to the system and verify that the app redirects them to the home page after successful login

\item{test-UAM-3\\}

\textbf{Description:} The user should be able to logout of the app

\textbf{Control:} Manual
					
\textbf{Initial State:} The user is already logged into the app
					
\textbf{Input:} Logout submission
					
\textbf{Output:} Account logout is successful, and the user is redirected to the login page

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} This test verifies that the app terminates the user's session and redirects the user to the login page to protect user's account data

\textbf{How test will be performed:} While logged in, a user/tester will click the logout button and observe that the user is redirected to the login screen. Verify that no user-specific data is accessible after logging out

\item{test-UAM-4}

\textbf{Description:} Users should be able to update account information after initial setup

\textbf{Control:} Manual

\textbf{Initial State:} User is logged in and on the account settings screen

\textbf{Input:} Modify fields (e.g., name or password) and save changes

\textbf{Output:} Updated account information is saved and reflected on the profile screen.

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} The test ensures that users are able to manage and update their account information after initial setup

\textbf{How test will be performed:} A tester/user will modify the account fields, save, and verify that updates are displayed correctly on the profile.
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Image Processing Tests}

This subsection covers tests required to verify tests revolving around receipt scanning and processing. The receipt scanner allows users to upload and preview images\\
\textit{Functional Requirements: FR8 - FR11}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{test-IP-1\\}

\textbf{Description:} User should be able to upload an image for processing

\textbf{Control:} Manual

\textbf{Initial State:} The application is on the receipt upload screen.

\textbf{Input:} Select and upload a receipt image from the device's file storage

\textbf{Output:} The uploaded image is successfully displayed for preview

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} The test verifies that users are able to upload images from their device and preview them before receipt scanning

\textbf{How test will be performed:} The user/tester will select an image from storage, upload it, and confirm the image preview correctly displayed

\item{test-IP-2\\}

\textbf{Description:} Users should be able to preview an uploaded image before processing and confirm/reupload the image based on preference

\textbf{Control:} Manual

\textbf{Initial State:} Image is uploaded and displayed as a preview.

\textbf{Input:} Confirm or reupload the previewed image

\textbf{Output:} Confirmed image proceeds to processing, or retake restarts the upload process

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} Ensures users can review and confirm the uploaded image, as required for accuracy before processing.

\textbf{How test will be performed:} The user/tester previews the image, confirms, and observes if it advances to processing. Alternatively, users can retake and verify they are taken back to the image upload process
\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Manual Expense Input Tests}

This subsection covers tests that verify functionality for allowing users to manually input their expenses in the case that their receipt is unable to be processed. 
The manual input system is responsible for outlining fields that the user must fill out for their expense(s) to be tracked.\\
\textit{Functional Requirements: FR12-13}

\begin{enumerate}
\item{test-MIS-1\\}

\textbf{Description:} Users should be able to manually input expenses

\textbf{Control:} Manual

\textbf{Initial State:} Image captured or uploaded cannot be processed or the user wants to manually input items from their receipt from the expense tracker view

\textbf{Input:} Entered items, item costs, item quantities, categories and receipt date

\textbf{Output:} Items, quantities, costs, categories and receipt date are correctly processed and displayed 

\textbf{Test Case Derivation:} Ensures users can manually input their receipt/expense in case their image isn't able to be processed or they want to manually input them. The test verifies that manually inputted expense data is processed correctly

\textbf{How test will be performed:} From the expense tracker page, the user/tester will select the “manually input expenses” option and fill out the corresponding fields for category, item, item cost and date. They will then validate that all manual entries have been processed in the finalized expenses screen and match their inputs.	

\end{enumerate}

\subsubsection{Database Management Tests}

\textbf{How test will be performed:} The tester/user sets a budget for a specific category, then verify it appears and updates as expected in tracking

\end{enumerate}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{The nonfunctional requirements for accuracy will likely just reference the
  appropriate functional tests from above.  The test cases should mention
  reporting the relative error for these tests.  Not all projects will
  necessarily have nonfunctional requirements related to accuracy.}

\wss{For some nonfunctional tests, you won't be setting a target threshold for
passing the test, but rather describing the experiment you will do to measure
the quality for different inputs.  For instance, you could measure speed versus
the problem size.  The output of the test isn't pass/fail, but rather a summary
table or graph.}

\wss{Tests related to usability could include conducting a usability test and
  survey.  The survey will be in the Appendix.}

\wss{Static tests, review, inspections, and walkthroughs, will not follow the
format for the tests given below.}

\wss{If you introduce static tests in your plan, you need to provide details.
How will they be done?  In cases like code (or document) walkthroughs, who will
be involved? Be specific.}

\subsection{Traceability Between Test Cases and Requirements}

\wss{Provide a table that shows which test cases are supporting which
  requirements.}

\section{Unit Test Description}

\wss{This section should not be filled in until after the MIS (detailed design
  document) has been completed.}

\wss{Reference your MIS (detailed design document) and explain your overall
philosophy for test case selection.}  

\wss{To save space and time, it may be an option to provide less detail in this section.  
For the unit tests you can potentially layout your testing strategy here.  That is, you 
can explain how tests will be selected for each module.  For instance, your test building 
approach could be test cases for each access program, including one test for normal behaviour 
and as many tests as needed for edge cases.  Rather than create the details of the input 
and output here, you could point to the unit testing code.  For this to work, you code 
needs to be well-documented, with meaningful names for all of the tests.}

\subsection{Unit Testing Scope}

\wss{What modules are outside of the scope.  If there are modules that are
  developed by someone else, then you would say here if you aren't planning on
  verifying them.  There may also be modules that are part of your software, but
  have a lower priority for verification than others.  If this is the case,
  explain your rationale for the ranking of module importance.}

\subsection{Tests for Functional Requirements}

\wss{Most of the verification will be through automated unit testing.  If
  appropriate specific modules can be verified by a non-testing based
  technique.  That can also be documented in this section.}

\subsubsection{Module 1}

\wss{Include a blurb here to explain why the subsections below cover the module.
  References to the MIS would be good.  You will want tests from a black box
  perspective and from a white box perspective.  Explain to the reader how the
  tests were selected.}

\subsection{Tests for Nonfunctional Requirements}

\wss{If there is a module that needs to be independently assessed for
  performance, those test cases can go here.  In some projects, planning for
  nonfunctional tests of units will not be that relevant.}

\wss{These tests may involve collecting performance data from previously
  mentioned functional tests.}
