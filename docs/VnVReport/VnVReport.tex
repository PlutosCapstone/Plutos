\section{Comparison to Existing Implementation}	

This section will not be appropriate for every project.

\section{Unit Testing}

\subsection{Front-end unit tests}

Front-end unit tests can be found in the \href{https://github.com/PlutosCapstone/Plutos/tree/main/src/client/tests}{test directory}

\subsubsection{Component Rendering}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} Each component is rendered in their corresponding unit test to ensure it renders without error and with all corresponding mock information correctly
  (i.e. the component rendered with mock expense data is expected to display the mock expense data)
  \item \textbf{Inputs:} The component \& component props
  \item \textbf{Expected Output:} Component renders without error and displays corresponding information
  \item \textbf{Result:} Pass
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Metrics}

This section describes the unit tests for calculating and displaying user metrics.

\vspace{10pt}
\textbf{Expense and Budget}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} Unit tests to render expense and budget metrics to validate: total expense value, total budget value, percentage of budget spent, and
  how much value for each budget category is left
  \item \textbf{Inputs:} Expense array, budget array
  \item \textbf{Expected Output:} Corresponding metrics are correctly calculated and displayed to users
  \item \textbf{Result:} Pass
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Expense categories}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} Unit test to render the expense metrics graph. This test validates that the graph correctly displays the top 5 expense categories by 
  total cost and accurately shows the percentage of each category.
  \item \textbf{Inputs:} Expense array
  \item \textbf{Expected Output:} The metrics are correctly calculated and displayed to users
  \item \textbf{Result:} Pass
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Manage resources}

This section describes the unit tests for managing the CRUD functions of budgets, incomes and expenses.

\vspace{10pt}
\textbf{Manage Expenses}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} Unit tests to display user expenses and allow users to add expense
  \item \textbf{Inputs:} Expenses array
  \item \textbf{Expected Output:} Expenses correctly rendered and displayed, users are able enter expense information and then save corresponding expense information
  \item \textbf{Result:} Pass
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Manage Budget}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} Unit tests to verify left over budget (or over budget if users have expensed more than their budget), total expenses, and budget for each expense category.
  Also will validate actions for deleting, editing and adding new budget.
  \item \textbf{Inputs:} Expenses array, budgets array
  \item \textbf{Expected Output:} Corresponding remaining budget displayed along with total expenses. Budget for each expense category correctly rendered
  \item \textbf{Result:} Pass
\end{itemize}

\textbf{Manage Income}

\begin{itemize}
  \item \textbf{Description:} Unit tests to validate user income(s) and how much more users are able to budget (if applicable). Also validates actions for deleting, editing and adding
  new income.
  \item \textbf{Inputs:} Incomes array, budgets array
  \item \textbf{Expected Output:} Corresponding income displayed along with the remaining budget. Users are able to enter income information and save it correctly. 
  Actions for deleting, editing, and adding new income are validated.
  \item \textbf{Result:} Pass
\end{itemize}

\section{Changes Due to Testing}

\wss{This section should highlight how feedback from the users and from 
the supervisor (when one exists) shaped the final product.  In particular 
the feedback from the Rev 0 demo to the supervisor (or to potential users) 
should be highlighted.}

\section*{Appendix --- Reflection}

The information in this section will be used to evaluate the team members on the
graduate attribute of Reflection.

\input{../Reflection.tex}

\begin{enumerate}
  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how
    did you resolve them?
  \item Which parts of this document stemmed from speaking to your client(s) or
  a proxy (e.g. your peers)? Which ones were not, and why?
  \item In what ways was the Verification and Validation (VnV) Plan different
  from the activities that were actually conducted for VnV?  If there were
  differences, what changes required the modification in the plan?  Why did
  these changes occur?  Would you be able to anticipate these changes in future
  projects?  If there weren't any differences, how was your team able to clearly
  predict a feasible amount of effort and the right tasks needed to build the
  evidence that demonstrates the required quality?  (It is expected that most
  teams will have had to deviate from their original VnV Plan.)
