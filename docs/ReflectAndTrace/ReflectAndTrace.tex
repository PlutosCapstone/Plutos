\section{Challenge Level and Extras}

\subsection{Challenge Level}


The expected challenge level is \textbf{general}. The primary challenge of the
project is developing a machine learning model that can accurately parse items
from a picture of a receipt, and to categorize them into appropriate spending
categories. This requires a strong understanding of training and tuning models
on image data to achieve high accuracy. Additionally, different items across
various stores may have similar names or be difficult to recognize, which adds
to the complexity of the task. The other part of the project is to develop a
user-friendly mobile application, which is a more general software engineering
component.

\end{enumerate}


\section{Design Iteration (LO11 (PrototypeIterate))}

From the get go, Plutos was designed around allowing students to scan receipts using OCR to automatically log their expenses. 
Our early prototypes validated this concept, but through iterative testing and feedback, we realized that effective receipt 
scanning was just one part of the budgeting experience. The surrounding user interface and workflow had to evolve to support 
that feature in a way that felt intuitive, helpful, and student-friendly.

Initially, the app's layout was minimal — receipts were scanned and stored in a chronological list, with categorized expenses displayed.
However, we found that while the scanning feature worked well, users often felt disconnected from their overall budget. 
They wanted to immediately understand how a new purchase impacted their spending limits. 
In response, we redesigned the post-scan experience to include a quick budget summary and
an intuitive workflow to allow them to see their spending trends, budget accordingly and also view all previous expenses regarding certain
spending categories.

Visually, we evolved from a generic, grey-toned interface to a more colorful, student-friendly aesthetic. 
This wasn’t just for looks — feedback suggested that students responded better to a more engaging interface, especially one with positive reinforcement 
(e.g. green progress bars, colourful graphs, etc.).

A few notable changes we made were decreasing the OCR accuracy constraint, and leaving out push notifications in the initial version of the app.
The OCR accuracy constraint was decreased to allow for a wider range of receipts to be scanned and after testing, we found that 
the parsed receipt data was still accurate enough to be useful to users. We also decided to leave out push notifications in the initial version of the app
because we already implemented in-app alerts once users input expenses that would exceed 80\% of their budget.
This was a conscious decision to avoid overwhelming users with notifications, and we didn't want to add stress to users who are already managing their finances.
We communicated this decision with users and through feedback, they expressed that even though they were slightly disappointed, they understood the reasoning behind our design decision
and also expressed that not having push notifications wasn't a deal breaker for them.

Throughout the design process, we gathered feedback from potential users and the team to iteratively improve
the design of the app. With each iteration, decisions were made with our target users in mind to identify
pain points early regrading budget visibility, personalization and overall design.

\section{Design Decisions (LO12)}

\textbf{Assumptions}\\

Early in the design process, we assumed students would be highly motivated to categorize every expense and analyze their spending in detail. 
However, user feedback showed that most students wanted to engage with the app quickly and only when necessary. 
This challenged us to shift our focus away from detailed manual categorization and toward quick, automatic summaries and passive insights.\vspace{10pt}\\ 
\textbf{Constraints}\\

The OCR accuracy constraint was decreased to enhance the model’s generalization, which in turn reduces ambiguity during data classification. 
A lower accuracy threshold encourages a more flexible model that avoids overfitting to the training data and can better adapt 
to unseen, real-world inputs. This is especially important when dealing with noisy, inconsistent, or highly varied data 
such as scanned receipts or user-generated content, where exact matches are less common. For the scope of this project, the team decided that by focussing on balancing accuracy and generalization, 
the model can remain lightweight and responsive while still offering meaningful performance. Additionally, the ability for users to modify 
misclassified entries will further help address any discrepancies and improve the overall accuracy 
over time through user feedback and potential retraining mechanisms.\vspace{10pt}\\
\textbf{Limitations}\\ 

We decided to leave out push notifications in the initial version of the app since we alert users once they've inputted an expense that exceeds 80\% of their budget in-app. 
This decision was made because we wanted to avoid overwhelming users with notifications, especially since they are already receiving in-app alerts. \vspace{10pt}\\
Striving for an extremely high accuracy and implementing push notifications could lead to longer development times with disproportionate benefits, so we decided to prioritize
a more streamlined and user-friendly experience over these features for the initial implementation.

\section{Economic Considerations (LO23)}

There is a clear growing market for budgeting and personal finance tools, especially amongst university students and young adults.
Young adults often face financial challenges during their early years of living independently, and are also often
unaware of the costs of living, driving the need for budgeting tools. However, being university students and young adults ourselves,
we understand the barrier to entry to start budgeting is high. As well, current budgeting tools are often too complex and overwhelming for
young adults to use, which is what drives the need for Plutos -- a simple yet effective way to track expenses and budget using receipt
photo scanning.

Marketing Plutos would involve a combination of digital outreach and grassroots efforts. This could include social media advertising 
(especially on platforms like Instagram and TikTok), collaborations with student organizations, and targeted campaigns during back-to-school periods. 
Additionally, in-person promotion at campus events and integration with student services at universities could help increase visibility and adoption.

Since the overhead cost of developing and maintaining Plutos is low, we would host the product on Google Play Store and Apple App Store for free
because we understand students wouldn't want to pay for a budgeting tool. However, we would offer a premium tier to allow users to 
utilize additional features such as advanced analytics, bank account integration, budgeting suggestions and exporting budgeting data
to a PDF or CSV. We estimate the cost of premium services to be \$1.99/month and with 105 monthly users, we'd be able to make money
and cover the costs of maintaining the app (since the app is low cost and will only require \$210/month to operate).

We believe this target is feasible as we have already surveyed ~20 students and all of them expressed interest in using Plutos.
With a potential user base of ~40,000 students just at McMaster University alone and our marketing plan, we believe that everyone can 
use Plutos immediately. 

\section{Reflection on Project Management (LO24)}

\subsection{How Does Your Project Management Compare to Your Development Plan}

Our team followed the development plan as outlined in the SRS Development Plan section.
We adhered to the planned meetings, communication methods, assigned roles, and workflow structure. 
The project was structured into phases, and we prioritized high-priority functional requirements as scheduled. 
While some deadlines were subject to change, we adapted accordingly to ensure steady progress.

At the start of the project, we had a general idea of using an OCR model to extract data from receipts, but we weren’t committed to a specific tool. 
Throughout the development process, we experimented with a few different OCR models to see which one would work best for our needs.
After testing and comparing results, we ultimately decided to use Tesseract, which is an open-source OCR engine developed by Google.

Tesseract provided the balance we were looking for in terms of accuracy and ease of integration. While some of the other models we tried had certain strengths, 
Tesseract performed consistently across a wide range of receipt types, and it was easier to work with in our app’s pipeline.
Even though we didn’t plan on using it from the beginning, the decision to pivot toward Tesseract ended up being a good one for the project.


\subsection{What Went Well?}

Our capstone group worked well together, maintaining strong organization and collaboration throughout the project.
Meetings and clear communication ensured that everyone stayed on track with their tasks.
Each team member effectively contributed to their assigned roles, which helped keep development on schedule.

A key success was the OCR model used to parse receipts. It met our expected accuracy, allowing us to extract and categorize receipt data effectively.
This was essential for the project's goal of creating an innovative expense-tracking budgeting app.

\subsection{What Went Wrong?}

Like any project, we encountered some challenges along the way. There were occasional difficulties in coordinating 
schedules, especially when balancing coursework with project deadlines. 

In terms of workflow, there were moments where certain tasks took longer than expected due to debugging and integration challenges.
However, the team adapted and adjusted the timeline as needed.

In terms of tools, one of the main challenges was our initial unfamiliarity with OCR models. Since most of us had limited prior experience working with OCR technology,
there was a learning curve when it came to understanding how different models worked, how to train or fine-tune them, and how to handle various types of receipt formats. 
It took time to experiment with different models and figure out how to integrate them into our pipeline effectively.

\subsection{What Would you Do Differently Next Time?}

For future projects, we would aim to refine our approach to time management by setting aside more buffer time for debugging and testing. 
While our communication was strong, we could improve further by implementing more structured progress tracking to ensure that any potential delays are addressed earlier.

\section{Reflection on Capstone}

\subsection{Which Courses Were Relevant}
Much of the knowledge that contributed to the development and completion of this project stemmed from the courses we took during our undergraduate studies. Several of 
these courses provided essential foundational knowledge, particularly our project courses such as ENGINEER 1P13 and 2PX3, which helped us establish a solid and efficient framework throughout the 
development process. Other courses supported us in the technical aspects of the project. All team members gained a fundamental understanding of machine learning 
through a recent elective, COMPSCI 4ML3, and we also applied insights from our software design and testing courses, which were SFWRENG 3A04 and 3S03 as well as our interface from
SFWRENG 4HC3 to effectively build our system. Overall, various elements of our project were informed by the knowledge we acquired in other courses.

\subsection{Knowledge/Skills Outside of Courses}

This project presented a new challenge for our entire team. Consequently, we approached the capstone as a valuable learning experience, recognizing our roles as 
both team contributors and students. Naturally, not all group members were fully acquainted with the technologies and systems involved in this project. For many, 
it was their first experience working with and training a real machine learning model. Additionally, developing a mobile application posed its own challenges, but 
our team demonstrated significant effort to overcome them. Throughout this project, we also cultivated important soft skills, such as effective collaboration and 
task delegation. The capstone represented a significant milestone in each of our professional careers and provided an excellent opportunity for learning.
