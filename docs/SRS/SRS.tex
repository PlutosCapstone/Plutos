\plt{This SRS template is based on \citet{SmithAndLai2005, SmithEtAl2007,
  SmithAndKoothoor2016}.  It will get you started.  You should not modify the
  section headings, without first discussing the change with the course
  instructor.  Modification means you are not following the template, which
  loses some of the advantage of a template, especially standardization.
  Although the bits shown below do not include type information, you may need to
  add this information for your problem.  If you are unsure, please can ask the
  instructor.}

\plt{Feel free to change the appearance of the report by modifying the LaTeX
  commands.}

\plt{This template document assumes that a single program is being documented.
  If you are documenting a family of models, you should start with a commonality
  analysis.  A separate template is provided for this.  For program
  families you should look at \cite{Smith2006, SmithMcCutchanAndCarette2017}.
  Single family member programs are often programs based on a single physical
  model.  General purpose tools are usually documented as a family.  Families of
  physical models also come up.}

\plt{The SRS is not generally written, or read, sequentially.  The SRS is a
  reference document.  It is generally read in an ad hoc order, as the need
  arises.  For writing an SRS, and for reading one for the first time, the
  suggested order of sections is:
\begin{itemize}
\item Goal Statement
\item Instance Models
\item Requirements
\item Introduction
\item Specific System Description
\end{itemize}
}

\plt{Guiding principles for the SRS document:
\begin{itemize}
\item Do not repeat the same information at the same abstraction level.  If
  information is repeated, the repetition should be at a different abstraction
  level.  For instance, there will be overlap between the scope section and the
  assumptions, but the scope section will not go into as much detail as the
  assumptions section.
\end{itemize}
}

\plt{The template description comments should be disabled before submitting this
  document for grading.}

\plt{You can borrow any wording from the text given in the template.  It is part
  of the template, and not considered an instance of academic integrity.  Of
  course, you need to cite the source of the template.}

\plt{When the documentation is done, it should be possible to trace back to the
  source of every piece of information.  Some information will come from
  external sources, like terminology.  Other information will be derived, like
  General Definitions.}

\plt{An SRS document should have the following qualities: unambiguous,
  consistent, complete, validatable, abstract and traceable.}

\plt{The overall goal of the SRS is that someone that meets the Characteristics
  of the Intended Reader (Section~\ref{sec_IntendedReader}) can learn,
  understand and verify the captured domain knowledge.  They should not have to
  trust the authors of the SRS on any statements.  They should be able to
  independently verify/derive every statement made.}

\section{Introduction}

\plt{The introduction section is written to introduce the problem.  It starts
  general and focuses on the problem domain. The general advice is to start with
a paragraph or two that describes the problem, followed by a ``roadmap''
paragraph.  A roadmap orients the reader by telling them what sub-sections to
expect in the Introduction section.}

\subsection{Purpose of Document}

The purpose of this SRS document is to describe the functional and non-functional requirements of the Plutos budgeting application. This document serves as a formal agreement between stakeholders, including developers, project managers, and end users, to ensure a shared understanding of the system's objectives, capabilities, and constraints. \\

\noindent The SRS defines the expectations for the project, detailing the system features, behaviour, and performance requirements. It serves as a reference throughout the development lifecycle, guiding the design, implementation, testing, and validation phases to ensure the final product meets the agreed-upon specifications. Additionally, this document will support future maintenance and scalability of the application by providing clear and detailed requirements that facilitate ongoing enhancements.

\subsection{Scope of Requirements} 

The scope of this project encompasses the development of a budgeting application, Plutos, that automates expense tracking 
and categorization using AI. The system is designed to address key pain points for young adults struggling to manage their 
finances, specifically focusing on automating the process of tracking spending through receipt scanning, categorization of 
expenses, providing metrics to users regarding their spending habits, and providing feedback on how users can meet their 
budgeting goals.\\

\noindent However, some features that are outside the scope of the project (though may be implemented later) are: 

\begin{itemize}
  \item The system will not account for complex financial scenarios such as investments, stock portfolios, or retirement planning.
  \item Advanced financial forecasting or predictive analytics beyond simple budgeting trends will not be implemented.
  \item The AI model will not handle non-standard or highly complex receipts (e.g., multi-page invoices or handwritten receipts).
  \item The application will not offer integration with external financial accounts such as credit cards or bank accounts.
  \item The model will be trained to detect receipt data from Fortinos and will not initially support various receipt formats.
\end{itemize}

\noindent These exclusions allow the project to concentrate on core features, such as receipt scanning and expense categorization, while ensuring a manageable scope for the development process.

\subsection{Characteristics of Intended Reader} \label{sec_IntendedReader}
The primary audience for this SRS document is the group of undergraduate software engineering students who will 
oversee and complete the project’s design and implementation. This group of specialists, which includes system architects, 
software developers, and quality assurance testers, has extensive experience in the range of technologies needed for 
the project. Through their coursework and personal experiences, they are familiar with the process of developing mobile 
applications, and as they move through the project milestones, they will deepen their understanding of artificial intelligence 
and machine learning. They will actively learn how to apply AI/ML technologies in real-world circumstances throughout 
the project, which will advance their development as software engineers. The collaborative effort will help them improve 
their real-world application development abilities as the project progresses through seven milestones, ensuring that they 
are prepared to produce a practical and user-friendly budgeting solution.
\subsection{Organization of Document}

The following sections of the SRS will further describe the system and its requirements. The sections will be as follows:

\begin{enumerate}
	\setcounter{enumi}{2}
	\item General System Description
	\item Specific System Description
	\item Requirements
	\item Likely Changes
	\item Unlikely Changes
	\item Traceability Matrices and Graphs
	\item Development Plan
	\item Values of Auxiliary Constants
\end{enumerate}

\section{General System Description}

This section provides general information about the system.  It identifies the
interfaces between the system and its environment, describes the user
characteristics and lists the system constraints.  \plt{This text can likely be
  borrowed verbatim.}

\plt{The purpose of this section is to provide general information about the
  system so the specific requirements in the next section will be easier to
  understand. The general system description section is designed to be
  changeable independent of changes to the functional requirements documented in
  the specific system description. The general system description provides a
  context for a family of related models.  The general description can stay the
  same, while specific details are changed between family members.}

\subsection{System Context}

\begin{figure}[h!]
  \centering
   \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{SystemContext.png}
  \caption{System Context}
  \label{Fig_SystemContext} 
\end{figure}

The system context for this project consists of a user(s), an expense tracking system, 
a budgeting analysis generator, and several databases. The user provides expense 
tracking inputs, such as physical/digital receipts or manual expense entries, and 
receives financial assessments. The expense tracking system processes user inputs, 
generates budgetary evaluations, and interacts with the financial analysis program 
and databases. The expense tracking system is also responsible for ensuring the 
validity of all inputs and provides a response if an invalid input is identified. 
The budgeting analysis generator provides expense categorization and evaluation 
functionalities, such as data analysis and visualization, and supports the expense 
tracking system in generating outputs. The database will be used to store user 
account information, user budget data, and supports the expense tracking system 
in storing and retrieving specific items and their respective categories. 
The system will typically be used for personal finance management, budgeting, 
and expense tracking, and may also be used for educational purposes. While 
the system is not safety-critical, it is important to ensure that the system is 
reliable and accurate in its calculations and analysis to provide users with 
trustworthy insights into their financial situation.



\plt{Your system context will include a figure that shows the abstract view of
  the software.  Often in a scientific context, the program can be viewed
  abstractly following the design pattern of Inputs $\rightarrow$ Calculations
  $\rightarrow$ Outputs.  The system context will therefore often follow this
  pattern.  The user provides inputs, the system does the calculations, and then
  provides the outputs to the user.  The figure should not show all of the
  inputs, just an abstract view of the main categories of inputs (like material
  properties, geometry, etc.).  Likewise, the outputs should be presented from
  an abstract point of view.  In some cases the diagram will show other external
  entities, besides the user.  For instance, when the software product is a
  library, the user will be another software program, not an actual end user.
  If there are system constraints that the software must work with external
  libraries, these libraries can also be shown on the System Context diagram.
  They should only be named with a specific library name if this is required by
  the system constraint.}

\begin{figure}[h!]
\begin{center}
 \includegraphics[width=0.6\textwidth]{SystemContextFigure}
\caption{System Context}
\label{Fig_SystemContext} 
\end{center}
\end{figure}

\plt{For each of the entities in the system context diagram its responsibilities
  should be listed.  Whenever possible the system should check for data quality,
  but for some cases the user will need to assume that responsibility.  The list
  of responsibilities should be about the inputs and outputs only, and they
  should be abstract.  Details should not be presented here.  However, the
  information should not be so abstract as to just say ``inputs'' and
  ``outputs''.  A summarizing phrase can be used to characterize the inputs.
  For instance, saying ``material properties'' provides some information, but it
  stays away from the detail of listing every required properties.}

\begin{itemize}
\item User Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item 
\end{itemize}
\item \progname{} Responsibilities:
\begin{itemize}
\item Detect data type mismatch, such as a string of characters instead of a
  floating point number
\item 
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\plt{Identify in what context the software will typically be used.  Is it for
exploration? education? engineering work? scientific work?. Identify whether it
will be used for mission-critical or safety-critical applications.} \plt{This
additional context information is needed to determine how much effort should be
devoted to the rationale section.  If the application is safety-critical, the
bar is higher.  This is currently less structured, but analogous to, the idea to
the Automotive Safety Integrity Levels (ASILs) that McSCert uses in their
automotive hazard analyses.}

\subsection{User Characteristics} \label{SecUserCharacteristics}

The users of the \textit{Plutos} budgeting application can be grouped into four main categories based on their financial experience and needs. These groups represent varying levels of financial literacy and desired interaction with budgeting tools.

\begin{enumerate}
	\item \textbf{First and Second-Year Undergraduate Students [Primary]} \\ 
		This group consists of young adults who are new to managing their finances independently, such as those living away from home for the first time. The characteristics of these users are as follows:
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Financial Knowledge:} Limited experience with budgeting, managing expenses like rent and groceries. Usually have limited financial independence.
			\item \textbf{Time Management:} Busy schedules juggling school, work, and social commitments. Likely to prefer simple, intuitive interfaces that reduce time spent on budgeting.
			\item \textbf{Pain Points:} Lack of education on budgeting, potential to overspend due to unfamiliarity with managing day-to-day expenses.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Upper-Year Undergraduate and Post-Graduate Students [Secondary]}
		This group includes more experienced students who have more financial independence as they have had experience managing their finances (in previous years living independently).  They have a better understanding of budgeting and have developed more mature spending habits.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Financial Knowledge:}  Some experience balancing school and work, likely to have a clearer understanding of budgeting needs and differentiating between wants and needs.
			\item \textbf{Time Management:} Likely to have more experience managing limited time and money, though they may still struggle with large financial decisions such as housing or loans.
			\item \textbf{Pain Points:}  May underestimate or overestimate budget needs, particularly with larger expenses.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Early Career Professionals [Tertiary]}
		New graduates or individuals recently introduced to the workforce fall into this category. They likely have more stable incomes and financial independence.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Financial Knowledge:} More knowledgeable about saving, budgeting, and managing recurring expenses but still learning to navigate significant financial decisions.
			\item \textbf{Time Management:} May experience stress due to work-related issues and life changes such as moving to a new city and budgeting/tracking expenses may be another stress inducer on top of the new environment.
			\item \textbf{Pain Points:} Struggles with planning for long-term financial goals or managing joint accounts with a partner.
		\end{itemize}
	\item \textbf{Retirees [Tertiary]}
		Although retirees are not a primary focus, they may use the application to simplify financial tracking and planning for a fixed income.
		\begin{itemize}
			\item \textbf{Financial Knowledge:} Likely to have extensive experience with financial management but may struggle to adapt to modern budgeting tools.
			\item \textbf{Time Management:} Older users may face physical limitations (e.g., difficulty typing or navigating) and slower adaptation to new technologies.
			\item \textbf{Pain Points:} Difficulty managing finances without a steady income and adapting to increased living expenses.
		\end{itemize}
\end{enumerate}

\subsection{System Constraints}

\begin{itemize}
  \item [C\refstepcounter{constraintnum}\theconstraintnum :] \textbf{Technical Constraints}
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The system must be developed as a mobile application using a cross-platform framework (e.g., React Native, Flutter) to ensure compatibility with both iOS and Android devices.
      \item The system must utilize a cloud-based backend technology (e.g., AWS, Firebase) to provide scalability and reliability.
      \item The system must integrate with a third-party OCR library (e.g., Tesseract OCR, Google Vision API) to provide optical character recognition functionality.
      \item The system must use a NoSQL database (e.g., MongoDB, Firebase) to store user account information and expense tracking data.
    \end{itemize}

  \item [C\refstepcounter{constraintnum}\theconstraintnum :] \textbf{Performance Constraints} 
    \begin{itemize}
      \item The system must be able to process user inputs and generate budgeting data and analysis outputs within a reasonable time frame (e.g., 2-3 seconds). 
      \item The system must be able to handle a minimum of 10 concurrent users without significant performance degradation. 
    \end{itemize}

  \item [C\refstepcounter{constraintnum}\theconstraintnum :] \textbf{Security Constraints} 
    \begin{itemize} 
      \item The system must implement secure password storage and authentication mechanisms using a third-party authentication service (e.g., Auth0, Firebase). 
      \item The system must ensure that all data transmitted between the client and server is encrypted using SSL/TLS protocol. 
    \end{itemize}
  
  \item [C\refstepcounter{constraintnum}\theconstraintnum :] \textbf{Environmental Constraints} 
    \begin{itemize} 
      \item The system must be designed to operate on a variety of mobile devices, including smartphones and tablets, with different screen sizes and operating systems. 
      \item The system must be able to operate in a variety of network environments, including Wi-Fi, cellular networks, and offline mode. 
    \end{itemize}
  
  \item [C\refstepcounter{constraintnum}\theconstraintnum :] \textbf{Regulatory Constraints} 
    \begin{itemize} 
      \item The system must comply with relevant data protection regulations (e.g., GDPR, CCPA) to ensure the privacy and security of user data. 
      \item The system must comply with relevant financial regulations (e.g., PCI-DSS) to ensure the secure handling of financial information. 
    \end{itemize}
\end{itemize}

\plt{System constraints differ from other type of requirements because they
  limit the developers' options in the system design and they identify how the
  eventual system must fit into the world. This is the only place in the SRS
  where design decisions can be specified.  That is, the quality requirement for
  abstraction is relaxed here.  However, system constraints should only be
  included if they are truly required.}

  \item Feedback loops where users receive insights based on their financial
  decisions, influencing future behavior
\end{itemize}

\plt{The purpose of this section is to clearly and unambiguously state the
  physical system that is to be modelled. Effective problem solving requires a
  logical and organized approach. The statements on the physical system to be
  studied should cover enough information to solve the problem. The physical
  description involves element identification, where elements are defined as
  independent and separable items of the physical system. Some example elements
  include acceleration due to gravity, the mass of an object, and the size and
  shape of an object. Each element should be identified and labelled, with their
  interesting properties specified clearly. The physical description can also
  include interactions of the elements, such as the following: i) the
  interactions between the elements and their physical environment; ii) the
  interactions between elements; and, iii) the initial or boundary conditions.}

\plt{The elements of the physical system do not have to correspond to an actual
physical entity.  They can be conceptual.  This is particularly important when
the documentation is for a numerical method. }

The physical system of \progname{}, as shown in Figure~?, includes the following
elements:

\begin{itemize}

\item[PS1:] 

\item[PS2:] ...

\end{itemize}

\subsection{Rationale}

\subsubsection{Scope Decisions}
The scope decisions were made with the intention of ensuring that the app delivers value to its target audience while remaining manageable within development constraints. The app focuses on personal budgeting features, including receipt scanning, expense categorization, budget tracking, and financial analysis. \\

\noindent\textbf{Rationale:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{User-Centered Design}: The scope focuses on features that users expect from a smart budgeting app, aligning with current market demands for personal finance tools that offer automation (e.g., receipt scanning) and financial insights.
    \item \textbf{Technical Feasibility}: The decision to include features like machine learning for receipt parsing is scoped within the team’s ability to implement using existing AI frameworks (e.g., OCR and NLP libraries).
    \item \textbf{Time and Resource Constraints}: By narrowing the scope to core personal finance features, the team ensures that the project can be completed within the specified timeline and budget, avoiding feature creep.
    \item \textbf{Single Currency Support at Launch}: Focusing on a single currency simplifies the design of financial calculations, data presentation, and reporting. Multi-currency support introduces complexity in areas such as exchange rate management, which can be deferred to a later phase.
    \item \textbf{No Offline Mode in the Initial Version}: Implementing an offline mode adds complexity to data synchronization and storage. By focusing on online features initially, the development team can ensure that the core functionalities (e.g., receipt scanning and expense categorization) perform optimally without additional constraints.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Modeling Decisions}
The app’s architecture follows a modular, service-oriented design, with key components such as receipt scanning, expense categorization, and budgeting reports being developed as independent, reusable modules.\\

\noindent\textbf{Rationale:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Scalability}: A modular approach allows the app to scale more easily by isolating functionalities into distinct services (e.g., a dedicated service for expense categorization). This reduces interdependencies and facilitates future growth.
    \item \textbf{Maintainability}: Modular components are easier to update and test, as changes to one service do not necessarily impact others. This also allows the app to accommodate feature updates and bug fixes more efficiently.
    \item \textbf{Reusability}: By designing reusable components (e.g., UI elements, API services), the app can easily extend its capabilities or integrate with other systems in the future.
    \item \textbf{Use of JSON for Data Exchange}: JSON is lightweight, human-readable, and widely used for web and mobile applications. Its simplicity makes it ideal for transmitting structured data between the client and server, ensuring smooth communication with minimal overhead.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Assumptions}
Several assumptions were made during the development and design process. These assumptions include the expectation that users will regularly scan receipts, that mobile users are the primary audience, and that financial data privacy is of utmost importance.\\

\noindent\textbf{Rationale:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Receipt Scanning}: The assumption that users will consistently scan receipts underpins the app’s core functionality. This assumption is based on trends observed in personal finance apps where automation is a key value proposition for users.
    \item \textbf{Mobile-First Audience}: It is assumed that the majority of users will access the app via mobile devices. This assumption is driven by the current dominance of mobile platforms for personal finance management, offering convenience and accessibility.
    \item \textbf{Privacy and Security}: The assumption that users expect high standards of data privacy and security informs the app’s adherence to regulations such as GDPR. Users handling sensitive financial data expect robust protection mechanisms.
    \item \textbf{Stable Internet Connection}: It is assumed that users will have access to a stable internet connection while using the app, especially for features that require cloud processing (e.g., receipt scanning, data syncing, and report generation).
    \item \textbf{Regular App Usage}: The assumption is that users will interact with the app on a regular basis (e.g., weekly or monthly), allowing the app to provide up-to-date financial insights and budgeting trends based on frequent input.
    \item \textbf{User Financial Literacy}: The app assumes a basic level of financial literacy among its users, meaning that they will be able to understand concepts like budgets, expenses, savings, and categories without extensive in-app education.
\end{itemize}

\subsubsection{Typical Values}
For certain features, typical values have been used to inform design and development, such as default budget categories, receipt parsing accuracy thresholds, and system performance benchmarks.\\

\noindent\textbf{Rationale:}
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textbf{Default Categories}: Common budgeting categories (e.g., groceries, utilities, transportation) are provided as default to simplify user onboarding and offer a familiar framework. These categories were selected based on industry standards and user behavior in similar apps.
    \item \textbf{Parsing Accuracy}: An accuracy threshold of 90\% for receipt parsing was established as the minimum acceptable standard, based on current machine learning capabilities and user expectations for automated processes.
    \item \textbf{Performance Benchmarks}: Typical values for system performance, such as load times of under 2 seconds for key operations (e.g., viewing reports), are set based on user experience research, ensuring that the app feels responsive and efficient.
    \item \textbf{Maximum Receipt Upload Size}: A limit of 5 MB per receipt ensures a balance between allowing high-resolution images for accurate OCR processing while keeping server storage and bandwidth requirements manageable. Users are encouraged to upload clear, focused images within this size limit.
    \item \textbf{User Transaction History Retention}: Storing up to 3 years of transaction history provides users with enough data to analyze long-term financial trends while limiting the storage requirements for each user. Older transactions could be archived or made available on demand.
    \item \textbf{Frequency of Budget Update Notifications}: Weekly budget update notifications help users stay on top of their spending without overwhelming them with too many alerts. Users are reminded to review their financial status regularly while avoiding notification fatigue.
    \item \textbf{Budget Category Limits}: Allowing up to 25 distinct budget categories provides users with enough flexibility to categorize their spending without overwhelming them with too many options. This value strikes a balance between personalization and simplicity.
\end{itemize}

should be provided for scope decisions, modelling decisions, assumptions and
typical values.}

\section{Traceability Matrices and Graphs}

The purpose of the traceability matrices is to provide easy references on what
has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  Every time a
component is changed, the items in the column of that component that are marked
with an ``X'' may have to be modified as well.  Table~\ref{Table:trace} shows the
dependencies of theoretical models, general definitions, data definitions, and
instance models with each other. Table~\ref{Table:R_trace} shows the
dependencies of instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each
other. Table~\ref{Table:A_trace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, and likely changes on
the assumptions.

\plt{You will have to modify these tables for your problem.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is not generally symmetric.  If GD1 uses A1, that
  means that GD1's derivation or presentation requires invocation of A1.  A1
  does not use GD1.  A1 is ``used by'' GD1.}

\plt{The traceability matrix is challenging to maintain manually.  Please do
  your best.  In the future tools (like Drasil) will make this much easier.}

\caption{Traceability Matrix Showing the Connections Between Requirements and Instance Models}
\label{Table:R_trace}
\end{table}

The purpose of the traceability graphs is also to provide easy references on
what has to be additionally modified if a certain component is changed.  The
arrows in the graphs represent dependencies. The component at the tail of an
arrow is depended on by the component at the head of that arrow. Therefore, if a
component is changed, the components that it points to should also be
changed. Figure~\ref{Fig_ATrace} shows the dependencies of theoretical models,
general definitions, data definitions, instance models, likely changes, and
assumptions on each other. Figure~\ref{Fig_RTrace} shows the dependencies of
instance models, requirements, and data constraints on each other.

  when filing in the template.}

\noindent \plt{Grammar, flow and \LaTeX advice:
\begin{itemize}
\item For Mac users \texttt{*.DS\_Store} should be in \texttt{.gitignore}
\item \LaTeX{} and formatting rules
\begin{itemize}
\item Variables are italic, everything else not, includes subscripts (link to
  document)
\begin{itemize}
\item \href{https://physics.nist.gov/cuu/pdf/typefaces.pdf}{Conventions}
\item Watch out for implied multiplication
\end{itemize}
\item Use BibTeX
\item Use cross-referencing
\end{itemize}
\item Grammar and writing rules
\begin{itemize}
\item Acronyms expanded on first usage (not just in table of acronyms)
\item ``In order to'' should be ``to''
\end{itemize}
\end{itemize}}

\noindent \plt{Advice on using the template:
\begin{itemize}
\item Difference between physical and software constraints
\item Properties of a correct solution means \emph{additional} properties, not
  a restating of the requirements (may be ``not applicable'' for your problem).
  If you have a table of output constraints, then these are properties of a
  correct solution.
\item Assumptions have to be invoked somewhere
\item ``Referenced by'' implies that there is an explicit reference
\item Think of traceability matrix, list of assumption invocations and list of
  reference by fields as automatically generatable
\item If you say the format of the output (plot, table etc), then your
  requirement could be more abstract
\end{itemize}

  \item What went well while writing this deliverable? 
  \item What pain points did you experience during this deliverable, and how did
  you resolve them?
  \item How many of your requirements were inspired by speaking to your
  client(s) or their proxies (e.g. your peers, stakeholders, potential users)?
  \item Which of the courses you have taken, or are currently taking, will help
  your team to be successful with your capstone project.
  \item What knowledge and skills will the team collectively need to acquire to
  successfully complete this capstone project?  Examples of possible knowledge
  to acquire include domain specific knowledge from the domain of your
  application, or software engineering knowledge, mechatronics knowledge or
  computer science knowledge.  Skills may be related to technology, or writing,
  or presentation, or team management, etc.  You should look to identify at
  least one item for each team member.
  \item For each of the knowledge areas and skills identified in the previous
  question, what are at least two approaches to acquiring the knowledge or
  mastering the skill?  Of the identified approaches, which will each team
  member pursue, and why did they make this choice?
